# twitch-acc-gen
 An account creator/follow bot for [twitch](https://twitch.tv)
 
# Reason for release
Recently I've been seeing a lot of services pop up for twitch, these services charge absolutely insane amounts and no one really knows how easy it really is to generate accounts and mass follow people. I'm hoping this program doesn't fuel the problem but instead tunes it down. I've also just been having this collecting dust on my desktop for a few months and needed a purpose for it (github stars).

# How to use
I will not be providing examples, just a general over view.

1.) get a few (or just one) API key from [scraperAPI](https://www.scraperapi.com)\
2.) get an API key and credits from [bestcaptchasolver](https://bestcaptchasolver.com)\
3.) get your twitch userID (you'll have you figure this out on your own, I did it so can you)

# Notice
Follow botting/account generation is against the TOS of twitch. I do not condone anyone using this tool. I made this tool as a passion project and decided to release it. Please do not **skid** this and please do not use this to create a toxic place on twitch.

# Credit(s)
[azaelgg](https://github.com/azaelgg) for even getting me interested in this in the first place. He also provided a lot of code for the follow bot initially.
